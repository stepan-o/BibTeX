@techreport{JointTransportResearchCentre2007,
abstract = {The standard cost-benefit analysis of transport infrastructure investment projects weighs a project's costs against users' benefits. This approach has been challenged on the grounds that it ignores wider economic impacts of such projects. At this International Transport Forum Round Table, leading academics and practitioners addressed these concerns and examined a range of potential approaches for evaluating wider impacts – negative as well as positive. They concluded that for smaller projects, it is better to focus on timely availability of results, even if this means forgoing sophisticated analysis of wider impacts. For larger projects or investment programs, customized analysis of these effects is more easily justifiable. Creating consistent appraisal procedures is a research priority.},

abstract = {This paper develops a practical framework for estimating the wider economic benefits generated from transport investments. The methodologies for measuring the broader set of influences, including agglomeration economies, increased output in imperfectly-competitive markets and welfare benefits arising from improved labour supply are identified. The gross domestic product (GDP) impacts from transport investments (often used as a proxy measure for a number of economic impacts that are the result of increased productivity that are not included in the set of welfare benefits in the cost benefit analysis) are also explored. The wider economic benefits are illustrated by a real project - the North West Rail Link, a 23. km rail link in north west of Sydney with an estimated investment of {\$}8.3 billion. The Sydney Strategic Travel Model (STM) was used to model the changes of trips made from private cars, trains and buses, and changes in travel time, waiting time and the generalised travel costs. These are combined with macroeconomic data on employment and productivity to estimate the welfare benefits and GPD impacts of the project. The study indicates that the wider economic benefits represent an 8{\%} mark up over the conventional economic user benefits in the benefit-cost calculation, the latter comprising value of travel time savings, accident reduction, road decongestion and externality benefits.},

@inproceedings{Kucirek2017,
abstract = {The Greater Golden Horseshoe Model (GGHM) is an advanced forecasting tool developed within the last year to address the transport planning and design needs of the greater Toronto Metropolitan Region, one of the fastest growing urban areas in North America. This new regional model contains a number of innovative features. All of the necessary data was available (2011 Transportation Travel Survey of 150,000 households, 2011 census, and thousands of highway volume counts) to develop all of the proposed recommendations. The GGHM contains a first step towards a full Activity Based Model with deployment of the framework developed for Phase I in San Diego. It includes a subset of ABM model components including a population synthesizer, auto ownership, long term location choice models and a daily activity pattern model. The transition to a trip-based framework follows the daily activity pattern model and begins with destination and mode choice, and assignment. A major element of the model was the incorporation of capacity, crowding and reliability in both mode choice and transit trip assignment. Capacity and crowding was first implemented in Sydney. The development and application of the model was based upon an intensive literature search and a stated preference (SP) survey. The Sydney work was considerably expanded to include stop and link reliability in Los Angeles. The Los Angeles work also included an even more detailed SP survey from respondents who experience over-capacity and crowded transit conditions on a daily basis. One of the key features of the nested logit mode choice model was the inclusion of a variable that measures the “benefit”, in the peak period, of the presence and frequency of off-peak GO Rail service. Estimation results from a stated-preference survey yielded a coefficient value that was equal to 8.2 minutes of equivalent in-vehicle time. The 8.2 minute benefit corresponded to approximately 10 minute service frequency. The new version of the GGHM included development of three special market models, including an air passenger, visitor and special event model. Initial applications of the model were for a region wide High-Occupancy Toll (HOT) lane study and a Metrolinx Transit System wide study.},
