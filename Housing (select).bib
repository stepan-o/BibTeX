abstract = {The Home Observation Assessment Method (HOAM) is a new method developed to carry out objective coding of family interaction over extended time periods in a home setting. It is a computer-compatible coding system that permits on-line data reduction of interactional variables emphasizing contextual and structural dimensions of family behavior. To date, the HOAM has been applied to the study of 31 families observed for a total of over 250 sessions. Initial analysis of data from these sessions indicates that coder reliability is high and that the HOAM successfully measures dimensions of family behavior independent of architectural aspects of the home setting. Preliminary findings also indicate that although families differ dramatically along the interactional dimensions measured by the HOAM, all families studied spent remarkably little time in decision-making behavior, suggesting that behavior in the home is predominantly "maintenance-oriented."},

@article{Cheshire2018,
abstract = {This paper summarises the evidence from recent research relating to the British Planning system's impact on the supply of development. Planning serves important economic and social purposes but it is essential to distinguish between restricting development relative to demand in particular places to provide public goods and mitigate market failure in other ways, including ensuring the future ability of cities to expand and maintain a supply of public goods and infrastructure; and an absolute restriction on supply, raising prices of housing and other urban development generally. Evidence is presented that there are at least four separate mechanisms, inbuilt into the British system, which result in a systematic undersupply of land and space for both residential and commercial purposes and that these have had important effects on both our housing market and the wider economy and on welfare more widely defined.},

@article{Leamer2007,
abstract = {Objective The primary objective was to evaluate the effect of statin therapy/lipid lowering therapy (LLT) on lipid profile, in adults presenting with first acute coronary event. Methods and material A multicentre, observational, prospective cohort study of lipid profiles pre- and post-statin therapy/LLT, among adult patients with confirmed diagnosis of first acute coronary event. The primary outcome measures were low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in mg/dl, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in mg/dl and triglycerides (TG) in mg/dl at baseline and end of study (EOS, 12 weeks [mean: 13.5 weeks]). Results Totally 474 patients completed the study. Number of patients with any LDL-C abnormality (LDL-C [all; LDL was abnormal, either alone or along with other lipid parameter(s)]) decreased from 118 (24.9{\%}) to 27 (5.7{\%}), and for LDL-C (only; only the LDL was abnormal), from 46 (9.7{\%}) to 13 (2.7{\%}), both from baseline to EOS. Of 118 patients with high LDL-C (all) at baseline, 91 (77.1{\%}) had reduction in LDL-C to {\textless}100 mg/dl, of which 54 (45.8{\%}) had LDL-C {\textless}70 mg/dl at EOS. The patients with LDL-C fraction abnormalities decreased, while HDL-C abnormalities increased at EOS from baseline. No major difference was observed at baseline and EOS in levels of TG (all [TG was abnormal, either alone or along with other lipid parameter(s)]) and TG (only [only the TG was abnormal]). Six (1.3{\%}) had seven serious adverse events. Conclusions Though statin therapy is effective in lowering LDL-C, there still remains residual dyslipidemia, which probably should be tackled with therapeutic and non-therapeutic options.Copyright {\textcopyright} 2016 Cardiological Society of India},
