abstract = {This paper describes a simple educational simulation tool to teach about agent-based modeling (ABM) and land use and transportation (LUT) interactions in urbanized regions. The relationship between land use and transportation in urban areas shows a dynamic complexity which is difficult to model with static or very aggregated approaches. Agent-based simulation is becoming a standard to model certain complex systems including LUT interactions. The LUT modeling with Agent-Based simulation has been evolving in the last 20 years and there are some complete models being applied to real metropolitan areas. In this paper, only some of the ingredients of those models are presented in an easy to explain agent-based model that can be used in classes. The model is based on a more simple one available in the software package Anylogic which was upgraded with many add-ons coming from transportation systems analysis requirements that have been introduced at TU Delft. The model logic is explained, including the way in which it can be used to run different experiments. The paper ends with an example of an experiment that can be done by students in class or as an assignment.},

@book{Miller1999,
abstract = {The nation's growth and the need to meet mobility, environmental, and energy objectives place demands on public transit systems. Current systems, some of which are old and in need of upgrading, must expand service area, increase service frequency, and improve efficiency to serve these demands. Research is necessary to solve operating problems, to adapt appropriate new technologies from other industries, and to introduce innovations into the transit industry. The Transit Cooperative Research Program (TCRP) serves as one of the principal means by which the transit industry can develop innovative near-term solutions to meet demands placed on it. The need for TCRP was originally identified in TRB Special Report 213—Research for Public Transit: New Directions, published in 1987 and based on a study sponsored by the Urban Project H-12 FY'96 ISSN 1073-4872 ISBN 0-309-06324-8 Library of Congress Catalog Card No. 99-71031 . 1999 Transportation Research Board Price {\$}22.00ID - 1535},

@article{Anas2007,
abstract = {RELU is a dynamic general equilibrium model of a metropolitan economy and its land use, derived by unifying in a theoretically valid way, models developed by one of the authors [Anas (1982), Anas-Arnott (1991, 1997), Anas-Kim (1996), Anas-Xu (1999)]. RELU equilibrates floor space, land and labor markets, and the market for the products of industries, treating development (construction and demolition), spatial interindustry linkages, commuting, and discretionary travel. Mode choices and equilibrium congestion on the highway network are treated by unifying RELU with the TRAN algorithm of stochastic user equilibrium [Anas-Kim (1990)]. The RELU-TRAN algorithm's performance for a stationary state is demonstrated for a prototype consisting of 4-building, 4-industry, 4-labor-type, 15-land-use-zone, 68-link-highway-network version of the Chicago MSA. The algorithm solves 656 equations in a special block-recursive convergent procedure by iterations nested within loops and loops within cycles. Runs show excellent and smooth convergence from different starting points, so that the number of loops within successive cycles continually decreases. The tests also imply a numerically ascertained unique stationary equilibrium solution of the unified model for the calibrated parameters.},

@article{Iacono2008,
abstract = {Modern urban regions are highly complex entities. Despite the difficulty of modeling every relevant aspect of an urban region, researchers have produced a rich variety of models dealing with interrelated processes of urban change. The most popular types of models have been those dealing with the relationship between transportation network growth and changes in land use and the location of economic activity, embodied in the concept of accessibility. This article reviews some of the more common frameworks for modeling transportation and land use change, illustrating each with some examples of operational models that have been applied to real-world settings. It then identifies new directions for future research in urban modeling and notes the important contributions of the field to date.},
