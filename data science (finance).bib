@article{Campbell2016,
abstract = {This paper reviews a variety of backtests that examine the adequacy of Value-at- Risk (VaR) measures. These backtesting procedures are reviewed from both a sta- tistical and risk management perspective. The properties of unconditional coverage and independence are dened and their relation to backtesting procedures is discussed. Backtests are then classied by whether they examine the unconditional coverage prop- erty, independence property, or both properties of a VaR measure. Backtests that ex- amine the accuracy of a VaR model at several quantiles, rather than a single quantile, are also outlined and discussed. The statistical power properties of these tests are examined in a simulation experiment. Finally, backtests that are specied in terms of a pre-specied loss function are reviewed and their use in VaR validation is discussed.},
