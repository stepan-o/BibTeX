@techreport{Tukey1993,
abstract = {The 1971-1977 early formulation of Exploratory Data Analysis, in terms of (a) results of some of its techniques and considerations which underlay, at var- ious depths, the choices realized in the books. The 1991-1995 development of Exploratory Analysis of Variance, described in its simplest (two-way table) form and barely sketched in general. Discussion of the changes in apparent philosophy caused by the need to communicate more complicated things, notches, hints, the likely impact on a revised edition of Exploratory Data Analysis 1977. Dreams and targets for what might happen in 1996-2005, with emphasis on Exploratory Regression and the combined use of multiple description.},

abstract = {Statistical errors are common in scientific literature and about 50{\%} of the published articles have at least one error. The assumption of normality needs to be checked for many statistical procedures, namely parametric tests, because their validity depends on it. The aim of this commentary is to overview checking for normality in statistical analysis using SPSS.},

@article{DAgostino1971a,
abstract = {We present a test of normality based on a statistic D which is up to a constant the ratio of Downton's linear unbiased estimator of the population standard deviation to the sample standard deviation. For the usual levels of significance Monte Carlo simulations indicate that Cornish-Fisher expansions adequately approximate the null distribution of D if the sample size is 50 or more. The test is an omnibus test, being appropriate to detect deviations from normality due either to skewness or kurtosis. Simulation results of powers for various alternatives when the sample size is 50 indicate that the test compares favourably with the Shapiro-Wilk W test, Vbl, b2 and the ratio of range to stand},
