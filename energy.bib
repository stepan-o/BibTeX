abstract = {Addressing the sustainable energy crisis in an objective manner, this enlightening book analyzes the relevant numbers and organizes a plan for change on both a personal level and an international scalefor Europe, the Untied States, and the world. In case study format, this informative reference answers questions surrounding nuclear energy, the potential of sustainable fossil fuels, and the possibilities of sharing renewable power with foreign countries. While underlining the difficulty of minimizing consumption, the tone remains positive as it debunks misinformation and clearly explains the calculations of expenditure per person to encourage people to make individual changes that will benefit the world at large.},

abstract = {Life-cycle assessment {\~{}}LCA! is a technique that is used worldwide by clients and their design team to assess the impact of$\backslash$ntheir projects on the environment. The main advantage of LCA is in supporting decision making with quantitative data. LCA inventories$\backslash$ncan be either fully developed or streamlined. Fully developed LCAs are time-consuming and costly to prepare. Streamlined LCAs can be$\backslash$nused as an effective decision-making tool when considering environmental performance during the design process, but with a loss of$\backslash$ninventory completeness. Acknowledging the advantages and disadvantages of both types of LCA, this paper proposes a hybrid LCA$\backslash$nmethod that uses input-output data to fill in those gaps routinely left in conventional LCA inventories. The developed hybrid LCA method$\backslash$nis demonstrated using a life-cycle energy study of eight different road designs, including vehicle manufacture, maintenance, replacement,$\backslash$nand operation. It was found that the road construction process was initially the most important, but in the long run the manufacture, use,$\backslash$nand maintenance of vehicles using the road {\~{}}which are an inevitable consequence of road construction! became paramount.},

@unpublished{Dewees2013,
abstract = {Economic evaluation of green or renewable power should compare the cost of renewable power with the cost savings from displaced fossil generation plus the avoided harm from reduced emissions of air pollution and greenhouse gases. We use existing estimates of the values of the harm and we calculate cost savings from renewable power based on wholesale spot prices of power in Ontario and steady-state estimates of the cost of new gas generation to estimate the value or affordability of various forms of renewable power in Ontario. We find that timing matters in evaluating intermittent renewable sources. Considering air pollution and greenhouse gases we find that coal generation is dominated by natural gas, supporting Ontario's policy of ending coal generation by 2014. Renewable power thus displaces gas. Dispatchable renewable generation sources, such as many biogas, biomass and some hydroelectric sites cause savings and reduced harm that can justify some of the Ontario Feed-in-Tariff prices up to {\$}130/MWh; other FIT prices are too high. Wind and solar power are variable, so the value of their power depends on system marginal costs when they generate. Wind's displacement of gas capacity costs is low because it cannot be depended upon when demand is high and generation is needed, so it justifies prices of only {\$}60 to {\$}95/MWh, less than the FIT price of {\$}115. Solar power justifies higher prices than wind, up to {\$}152/MWh because solar generates in the daytime when prices are higher and when solar can fairly reliably displace gas capacity. Still, solar power falls far short of justifying the 2012 Ontario FIT prices of {\$}347 to {\$}549/MWh. Ontario's Feed-in-Tariff program costs more than necessary to achieve its environmental goals.},

abstract = {The International Energy Agency (IEA), an autonomous agency, was established in November 1974. Its primary mandate was – and is – two-fold: to promote energy security amongst its member countries through collective response to physical disruptions in oil supply, and provide authoritative research and analysis on ways to ensure reliable, affordable and clean energy for its 29 member countries and beyond. The IEA carries out a comprehensive programme of energy co-operation among its member countries, each of which is obliged to hold oil stocks equivalent to 90 days of its net imports. The Agency's aims include the following objectives: n Secure member countries' access to reliable and ample supplies of all forms of energy; in particular, through maintaining effective emergency response capabilities in case of oil supply disruptions. n Promote sustainable energy policies that spur economic growth and environmental protection in a global context – particularly in terms of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions that contribute to climate change. n Improve transparency of international markets through collection and analysis of energy data. n Support global collaboration on energy technology to secure future energy supplies and mitigate their environmental impact, including through improved energy efficiency and development and deployment of low-carbon technologies. n Find solutions to global energy challenges through engagement and dialogue with non-member countries, industry, international organisations and other stakeholders.},
