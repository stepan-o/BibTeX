abstract = {Poverty has been increasingly conceptualized as being multidimensional, involving deprivation in many dimensions of life. This paper discusses issues and implications of multidimensional poverty by adopting concepts commonly used in ecological economics. In particular, poverty is approached as an irreducible, complex phenomenon for which many legitimate, but non-equivalent descriptions exist. Issues of social and technical incommensurability are illustrated for different meanings and measurement types of poverty. Georgescu-Roegen's flow/fund framework is interpreted, informed by the capability approach of Amartya Sen. The paper argues that a predominant focus on flows as a proxy to analyze poverty represents rather a short-term perspective on access to satisfiers to fulfill particular needs. Contrary to that, focusing on valued funds may provide useful information for the analysis of capabilities that persons and societies might pursue in the long term. Furthermore, it is argued that strong poverty alleviation needs to adopt analytical tools that can deal with non-trade-off cases: improvements in one poverty dimension cannot always compensate for the deterioration of other poverties. This implies to rethink the usefulness of aggregate multidimensional poverty indices, as well as the predominant use of income measures. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The Home Observation Assessment Method (HOAM) is a new method developed to carry out objective coding of family interaction over extended time periods in a home setting. It is a computer-compatible coding system that permits on-line data reduction of interactional variables emphasizing contextual and structural dimensions of family behavior. To date, the HOAM has been applied to the study of 31 families observed for a total of over 250 sessions. Initial analysis of data from these sessions indicates that coder reliability is high and that the HOAM successfully measures dimensions of family behavior independent of architectural aspects of the home setting. Preliminary findings also indicate that although families differ dramatically along the interactional dimensions measured by the HOAM, all families studied spent remarkably little time in decision-making behavior, suggesting that behavior in the home is predominantly "maintenance-oriented."},

This first paper discusses the senses in which there are no {\{}$\backslash$textbackslash{\}}textita priori distinctions between learning algorithms. {\{}(The{\}} second paper discusses the senses in which there are such distinctions.) In this first paper it is shown, loosely speaking, that for any two algorithms A and B, there are “as many” targets (or priors over targets) for which A has lower expected {\{}OTS{\}} error than B as vice-versa, for loss functions like zero-one loss. In particular, this is true if A is cross-validation and B is “anti-cross-validation” (choose the learning algorithm with largest cross-validation error). This paper ends with a discussion of the implications of these results for computational learning theory. It is shown that one can not say: if empirical misclassification rate is low; the {\{}Vapnik-Chervonenkis{\}} dimension of your generalizer is small; and the training set is large, then with high probability your {\{}OTS{\}} error is small.

@article{Jacobsen2003,
abstract = {Objective: To examine the relationship between the numbers of people walking or bicycling and the frequency of collisions between motorists and walkers or bicyclists. The common wisdom holds that the number of collisions varies directly with the amount of walking and bicycling. However, three published analyses of collision rates at specific intersections found a non-linear relationship, such that collisions rates declined with increases in the numbers of people walking or bicycling. Data: This paper uses five additional data sets (three population level and two time series) to compare the amount of walking or bicycling and the injuries incurring in collisions with motor vehicles. Results: The likelihood that a given person walking or bicycling will be struck by a motorist varies inversely with the amount of walking or bicycling. This pattern is consistent across communities of varying size, from specific intersections to cities and countries, and across time periods. Discussion: This result is unexpected. Since it is unlikely that the people walking and bicycling become more cautious if their numbers are larger, it indicates that the behavior of motorists controls the likelihood of collisions with people walking and bicycling. It appears that motorists adjust their behavior in the presence of people walking and bicycling. There is an urgent need for further exploration of the human factors controlling motorist behavior in the presence of people walking and bicycling. Conclusion: A motorist is less likely to collide with a person walking and bicycling if more people walk or bicycle. Policies that increase the numbers of people walking and bicycling appear to be an effective route to improving the safety of people walking and bicycling.},

@article{Hass2015,
abstract = {War can create a massive amount of death while also straining the capacity of states and civilians to cope with disposing of the dead. This paper argues that such moments exacerbate contradictions between three fields and "economies" (logics of interaction and exchange) - a political, market, and moral economy of disposal - in which order and control, commodification and opportunism, and dignity are core logics. Each logic and economy, operating in its own field, provides an interpretation of the dead that emerges from field logics of normal organization, status, and meanings of subjects (as legal entities, partners in negotiation, and subjects with biographies and dignity). Using the case of the Blockade of Leningrad, with its massive amount of civilian death, this essay examines how local authorities followed an expedient logic to maintain order; how state workers charged with disposal followed an instrumental logic of gain; and how civilians tried to maintain a logic of dignity but were forced by desperation to act contingently and instrumentally. The analysis suggests a broader application of field theory beyond organizational communities; how culture in fields operates via entities of valence (anchors); and the need to make emotions and social distance clearer in frameworks of fields, culture, and practice.},

abstract = {Recent housing policies include measures for home purchase control and shanty town redevelopment. This study proposes sustainable pricing, in that the long-run equilibrium price is determined by the fundamentals of house prices. We argue that changes in CPI might have led to rapidly growing house prices and rather high price levels. We investigate the long-run or short-run impacts of new commodity housing completions, transacted square meters of commodity housing, and CPI for house prices in Shanghai. We adopt monthly data for the period of 2005–2010. We test for unit roots using both the ADF and PP techniques and structural breaks using both the Zivot-Andrews (Model B) and Perron (Model C) methods. Considering Cheung-Lai and Reinsel–Ahn finite-sample corrections, the results suggest a long-run equilibrium. Housing completions negatively impact house prices in the short run. A positive volume-price relationship is suggested. Housing sales affect house prices in the short run but not vice versa. Hence, the empirical evidence supports the search model. In addition, CPI is strongly exogenous with respect to the long-run relationship and thus is a long-term determinant of house prices. CPI also positively and drastically influences house prices in the short run. Therefore, a reduction in inflation rate could stabilize house prices, increasing the chances of sustainable prices in the future.},

abstract = {At Carbon Engineering, we have built a prototype air contactor with 10m3of packing volume, and have absorbed carbon dioxide from ambient air for over 1000 hours of outdoor operation. Our prototype was built to: A) test our cross-flow, pulsed-liquid, PVC packing-based contactor design in an operational environment; b) to evaluate fan and liquid pumping energy requirements of our design; c) to assess technical and safety risks involved with liquid solution loss through entrained "drift" droplets, and; d) to examine for packing or solution fouling by atmospheric particulates. In this paper we present our results on the liquid pumping and fan energy requirements of our prototype, and show preliminary analyses we have conducted on liquid loss through "drift" droplets and NPE fouling. Our operation with pulsed liquid flow allows us to fully wet the surface of our structured packing with a brief period of full flow, then to cut flow for a duration of several minutes to let the liquid slowly react away as CO2is absorbed. Using this technique we have cut average liquid flow to 10{\%} of full manufacturer's specifications while retaining an average of over 80{\%} of the capture rate observed at full flow. This method, under patent application, has allowed us to reduce our mgh fluid pumping energy requirement for the contactor to {\textless}40 MJ/ton-CO2({\textless}11 kWh/ton-CO2). Here we report this energy requirement without accounting for pump efficiency, which we nominally assume to be $\eta$pump=90{\%}. Our prototype contactor has utilized high-performance XF12560 structured packing from Brentwood Industries (Reading, PA), manufactured from PVC rather than a stainless-steel. This choice has given us several advantages, chiefly that it costs far less on a per-surface-area basis, and that is provides a much lower pressure drop on a per- surface-area basis. We have previously shown data that suggests these plastic packings absorb CO2with equal performance to traditional stainless-steel designs once wetted properly [1]. The high-performance and low pressure drop characteristics of our XF12560 product have allowed us to achieve PV work requirements of {\textless}350 MJ/ton-CO2({\textless}100 kWh/ton-CO2). Again, this value does not reflect fan efficiency, which we commonly use as $\eta$fan=55{\%} in our analyses. This current value for PV work requirement is higher than we had previously reported, due to a specific cause of under-performance in our prototype which is discussed in this paper. Despite this, we are in fact very encouraged by the results of our first attempt at long-duration outdoor contacting, and we have numerous design improvements stemming from our prototype operation that will be included in the next iteration of our full-scale contactor design. Extensive air sampling was carried out during our contactor operation to measure the loss of liquid solution via "drift" droplets during normal pulesd-flow contactor operation, 6 hour air samples taken from the contact outflow and measured for our K+ ion tracer, showed OH concentrations to be {\textless}5{\%} of the OHSA regulated indoor respiratory requirement. After our 1000 hours of integrated CO2absorption time, we have as of yet been unable to observe any significant performance decrease in the absorptive properties of our working solution or in the efficiency of our structured packing product.},

abstract = {Recently, the environmental impact of wind farms has been receiving increasing attention. As land is more extensively exploited for onshore wind farms, they are more likely to be in proximity with human dwellings, increasing the likelihood of a negative health impact. Noise generation and propagation remain an important concern for wind farm's stakeholders, as compliance with mandatory noise limits is an integral part of the permitting process. In contrast to previous work that included noise only as a design constraint, this work presents continuous-location models for layout optimization that take noise and energy as objective functions, in order to fully characterize the design and performance spaces of the wind farm layout optimization (WFLOP) problem. Based on Jensen's wake model and ISO-9613-2 noise calculations, single-and multi-objective genetic algorithms (GAs) are used to solve the optimization problem. Results from this bi-objective optimization model illustrate the trade-off between energy generation and noise production by identifying several key parts of Pareto frontiers. In particular, it was observed that different regions of a Pareto front correspond to markedly different turbine layouts. The implications of noise regulation policy-in terms of the actual noise limit-on the design of wind farms are discussed, particularly in relation to the entire spectrum of design options. {\textcopyright} 2014 by ASME.},

At this International Transport Forum Round Table, leading academics and practitioners addressed these concerns and examined a range of potential approaches for evaluating wider impacts – negative as well as positive. They concluded that for smaller projects, it is better to focus on timely availability of results, even if this means forgoing sophisticated analysis of wider impacts. For larger projects or investment programs, customized analysis of these effects is more easily justifiable. Creating consistent appraisal procedures is a research priority.},

abstract = {Studying the social dynamics of a city on a large scale has tra- ditionally been a challenging endeavor, often requiring long hours of observation and interviews, usually resulting in only a partial depiction of reality. To address this difficulty, we introduce a clustering model and research methodology for studying the structure and composition of a city on a large scale based on the social media its residents generate.We ap- ply this newmethodology to data from approximately 18 mil- lion check-ins collected from users of a location-based online social network. Unlike the boundaries of traditional munici- pal organizational units such as neighborhoods, which do not always reflect the character of life in these areas, our clusters, which we call Livehoods, are representations of the dynamic areas that comprise the city.We take a qualitative approach to validating these clusters, interviewing 27 residents of Pitts- burgh, PA, to see how their perceptions of the city project onto our findings there. Our results provide strong support for the discovered clusters, showing how Livehoods reveal the distinctly characterized areas of the city and the forces that shape them. Introduction},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t Online Social Media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, enable all users, independently of their characteristics, to freely generate and consume huge amounts of data. While this data is being exploited by individuals and organisations to gain competitive advantage, a substantial amount of data is being generated by spam or fake users. One in every 200 social media messages and one in every 21 tweets is estimated to be spam. The rapid growth in the volume of global spam is expected to compromise research works that use social media data, thereby questioning data credibility. Motivated by the need to identify and filter out spam contents in social media data, this study presents a novel approach for distinguishing spam vs. non-spam social media posts and offers more insight into the behaviour of spam users on Twitter. The approach proposes an optimised set of features independent of historical tweets, which are only available for a short time on Twitter. We take into account features related to the users of Twitter, their accounts and their pairwise engagement with each other. We experimentally demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of our approach and compare it to a typical feature set for spam detection in the literature, achieving a significant improvement on performance. In contrast to prior research findings, we observe that an average automated spam account posted at least 12 tweets per day at well defined periods. Our method is suitable for real-time deployment in a social media data collection pipeline as an initial preprocessing strategy to improve the validity of research data. {\textcopyright}},

We collected a sample of over 60,000 tweets using 3 key hashtags during the period of 6 days including before, during and after the 2016 local elections. The study involved performing a collection of correlation and regression analyses to compare daily mood with daily changes in the price of the FTSE 100 at the market level. The findings suggest that there is evidence of correlation between the general mood of the public and investment behavior in the short term; however, the relationship is not yet determined as statistically significant. There is also evidence of causation between public sentiment and the stock market movements, in terms of the relationship between MOOD and the daily closing price, and the time lag findings of MOOD and PRICE. Overall, these results show promise for using sentiment analytics on Twitter data for forecasting market movements.},

abstract = {The City of Vancouver is one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in North America. It has an extensive bicycle network that is well used by residents and visitors, and has one of the highest cycling mode shares among major North American cities. Transportation 2040, sets a target that two-thirds of all trips by 2040 will be made by walking, cycling or transit. Transportation 2040 also sets a target to work towards zero traffic-related fatalities, and places a special emphasis on safety for vulnerable road users, including pedestrians and cyclists. One of the recommended actions in Transportation 2040 was the development of a city-wide Cycling Safety Study to provide a better understanding of cycling safety hotspots and concerns. The Cycling Safety Study provides a comprehensive and objective review of the safety of cycling in the City of Vancouver and provides an action plan to address each of the identified cycling safety issues. This study involved an in-depth analysis of all collisions reported to the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC) involving bicycle users and motor vehicles in the City of Vancouver between 2007 and 2012i. In addition, this study analyzed the injury data from bicycling crashes that resulted in treatment at a hospital emergency room in Vancouver in 2008 and 2009 from the Bicyclists{\^{a}}€™ Injuries and Cycling Environment (BICE) study conducted through the University of British Columbia Cycling and Cities programii. Based on these datasets, the analysis examined WHERE reported cycling collisions and injury crashes took place, HOW they occurred, WHEN they took place, and WHO was involved. The ICBC data included 2,994 reported cycling collisions between 2007 and 2012 in the City of Vancouver, equivalent to an average of approximately 500 reported cycling collisions per year, or approximately 1.0{\%} of all reported collisions involving motor vehicles over this period. The overall number of reported cycling collisions in Vancouver has been relatively stable on an annual basis over the past fifteen years and beyond, despite a significant increase in the City{\^{a}}€™s population as well as the number of bicycle trips made over this period. As a result, the rate of cycling collisions in Vancouver has been steadily declining over the past fifteen years.},

abstract = {Efforts have intensified to apply a more evidence-based approach to traffic safety. One such effort is the Highway Safety Manual, which provides typical safety performance functions (SPFs) for common road types. SPFs model the mathematical relationship between frequency of crashes and the most significant causal factors. Unfortunately, the manual provides no SPFs for bicyclists, despite disproportionately high fatalities among this group. In this paper, a method for creating city-specific, bicycle SPFs is presented and applied to Boulder, Colorado. This is the first time a bicycle SPF has been created for a U.S. city. Such functions provide a basis for both future investigations into safety treatment efficacy and for prioritizing intersections to better allocate scarce funds for bicycle safety improvements. As expected, the SPFs show that intersections with higher bicyclist traffic and higher motorist traffic have higher motorist-cyclist collisions. The SPFs also demonstrate that intersections with more cyclists have fewer collisions per cyclist, illustrating that cyclists are safer in numbers. Intersections with fewer than 200 entering cyclists have substantially more collisions per cyclist. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Concerns about sustainability in agricultural systems centre on the need to develop technologies and practices that do not have adverse effects on environmental goods and services, are accessible to and effective for farmers, and lead to improvements in food productivity. Despite great progress in agricultural productivity in the past half-century, with crop and livestock productivity strongly driven by increased use of fertilizers, irrigation water, agricultural machinery, pesticides and land, it would be over-optimistic to assume that these relationships will remain linear in the future. New approaches are needed that will integrate biological and ecological processes into food production, minimize the use of those non-renewable inputs that cause harm to the environment or to the health of farmers and consumers, make productive use of the knowledge and skills of farmers, so substituting human capital for costly external inputs, and make productive use of people's collective capacities to work together to solve common agricultural and natural resource problems, such as for pest, watershed, irrigation, forest and credit management. These principles help to build important capital assets for agricultural systems: natural; social; human; physical; and financial capital. Improving natural capital is a central aim, and dividends can come from making the best use of the genotypes of crops and animals and the ecological conditions under which they are grown or raised. Agricultural sustainability suggests a focus on both genotype improvements through the full range of modern biological approaches and improved understanding of the benefits of ecological and agronomic management, manipulation and redesign. The ecological management of agroecosystems that addresses energy flows, nutrient cycling, population-regulating mechanisms and system resilience can lead to the redesign of agriculture at a landscape scale. Sustainable agriculture outcomes can be positive for food productivity, reduced pesticide use and carbon balances. Significant challenges, however, remain to develop national and international policies to support the wider emergence of more sustainable forms of agricultural production across both industrialized and developing countries.},

abstract = {Nineteenth-century landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted described his most famous project, the design of New York's Central Park, as "a democratic development of highest significance." Over the years, the significance of green in civic life has grown. In twenty-first-century America, not only open space but also other issues of sustainability—such as potable water and carbon footprints—have become crucial elements in the quality of life in the city and surrounding environment. Confronted by a U.S. population that is more than 70 percent urban, growing concern about global warming, rising energy prices, and unabated globalization, today's decision makers must find ways to bring urban life into balance with the Earth in order to sustain the natural, economic, and political environment of the modern city.In Growing Greener Cities, a collection of essays on urban sustainability and environmental issues edited by Eugenie L. Birch and Susan M. Wachter, scholars and practitioners alike promote activities that recognize and conserve nature's ability to sustain urban life. These essays demonstrate how partnerships across professional organizations, businesses, advocacy groups, governments, and individuals themselves can bring green solutions to cities from London to Seattle. Beyond park and recreational spaces, initiatives that fall under the green umbrella range from public transit and infrastructure improvement to aquifer protection and urban agriculture.Growing Greener Cities offers an overview of the urban green movement, case studies in effective policy implementation, and tools for measuring and managing success. Thoroughly illustrated with color graphs, maps, and photographs, Growing Greener Cities provides a panoramic view of urban sustainability and environmental issues for green-minded city planners, policy makers, and citizens.},

abstract = {AN ANALYSIS OF FAO'S 2018-2019 WORK PLAN ➨ Agroecology accounts for eight percent of FAO's results planned for 2018-2019 that support transitions to sustainable food and agriculture. ➨ Two-thirds (64 percent) of these results will be delivered in 78 countries across all five geographic regions addressing food security, nutrition and health, access to markets for local production, family-and small-scale production, climate-resilient approaches, sustainable natural resource management and sustainable food systems and livelihoods. ➨ Opportunities exist for further incorporating and upscaling agroecology in FAO's work through better integration of the agricultural sectors (crop and livestock production, forestry, aquaculture and fisheries) and transition towards sustainable food systems approaches in collaboration with partners particularly at country and regional levels. Agroecology can support the achievement of multiple objectives – economic, environmental, social, nutritional, health and cultural – holistically. It is an approach that contributes directly to the achievement of thirteen of the Sustainable Development Goals, while significantly increasing the resilience of both people and the environment, mitigating climate change, and sustainably using and conserving natural resources and biodiversity. A systemic approach, involving relevant agricultural and food sectors and stakeholders in the broad adoption of agroecology, has the potential to greatly accelerate the transition to sustainable and resilient food systems, in line with the various international commitments made by member nations. Based on an analysis of FAO's work plan for 2018-2019, this document presents an overview of FAO's engagement in agroecology and summarizes the main gaps and opportunities for upscaling. The criteria of analysis are based on four levels of changes to convert today's agricultural production and food systems to agroecological food systems (levels of transition; Fig. 1). 1 1 A case by case analysis of FAO's results agreed in the 2018-2019 Work Plan has been conducted classifying the results regarding their contribution to one or more of the four levels of transition.

abstract = {Thoughtful leaders increasingly recognize that we are not only failing to solve the persistent problems we face, but are in fact causing them. System dynamics is designed to help avoid such policy resistance and identify high-leverage policies for sustained improvement. What does it take to be an effective systems thinker, and to teach system dynamics fruitfully? Understanding complex systems requires mastery of concepts such as feedback, stocks and flows, time delays, and nonlinearity. Research shows that these concepts are highly counterintuitive and poorly understood. It also shows how they can be taught and learned. Doing so requires the use of formal models and simulations to test our mental models and develop our intuition about complex systems. Yet, though essential, these concepts and tools are not sufficient. Becoming an effective systems thinker also requires the rigorous and disciplined use of scientific inquiry skills so that we can uncover our hidden assumptions and biases. It requires respect and empathy for others and other viewpoints. Most important, and most difficult to learn, systems thinking requires understanding that all models are wrong and humility about the limitations of our knowledge. Such humility is essential in creating an environment in which we can learn about the complex systems in which we are embedded and work effectively to create the world we truly desire.

RELU equilibrates floor space, land and labor markets, and the market for the products of industries, treating development (construction and demolition), spatial interindustry linkages, commuting, and discretionary travel. Mode choices and equilibrium congestion on the highway network are treated by unifying RELU with the TRAN algorithm of stochastic user equilibrium [Anas-Kim (1990)]. The RELU-TRAN algorithm's performance for a stationary state is demonstrated for a prototype consisting of 4-building, 4-industry, 4-labor-type, 15-land-use-zone, 68-link-highway-network version of the Chicago MSA. The algorithm solves 656 equations in a special block-recursive convergent procedure by iterations nested within loops and loops within cycles. Runs show excellent and smooth convergence from different starting points, so that the number of loops within successive cycles continually decreases. The tests also imply a numerically ascertained unique stationary equilibrium solution of the unified model for the calibrated parameters.},

LOSS reflects how the roadway segment is performing in regard to its expected accident frequency and severity at a specific level of annual average daily traffic. It provides a comparison of accident frequency and severity only with the expected norms; it does not, however, provide any information related to the nature of the safety problem itself. If the safety problem is present, LOSS will describe only its magnitude. The nature of the problem is determined through diagnostic analysis by direct diagnostics and pattern recognition techniques, which are also discussed.},

abstract = {In her reading of Ginzburg's notes about the siege of Leningrad, Irina Sandomirskaia emphasizes Ginzburg's conceptualization of besiegement as the imprisonment of a polity inside a tautology. In the reality of the siege as depicted by Ginzburg, the extinction of life occurs in a self-devastating repetitiveness that dominates space, time, body, communication, action, thought, and ethics. Sandomirskaia interprets Ginzburg's conceptualization of besiegement from within in terms of Michel Foucault's biopower, when life is administered and selectively awarded as an entitlement, depending on how the administration understands the usefulness of that life for the war economy. As a result, a dystrophic body politic develops, as the polis in besiegement is subject to devastation and implosion, reproducing the bodily processes of a patient dying from alimentary dystrophy. Ginzburg resolutely questions the biopolitical solution by presenting an alternative in the individual politics of "loopholes of lesser evil."},

abstract = {Although wind technology produces no emissions during operation, there is an environmental impact associated with the wind turbine during the entire life cycle of the plant, from production to dismantling. A life cycle assessment is carried out to quantify the environmental impact of two existing wind turbines, a 1.8 MW-gearless turbine and a 2.0 MW turbine with gearbox. Both technologies will be compared by means of material usage, carbon dioxide emissions and energy payback time based on the cumulative energy requirements for a 20 year life period. For a quantitative analysis of the material and energy balances over the entire life cycle, the simulation software GEMIS{\textregistered}(Global Emission Model of Integrated System) is used.The results show, as expected, that the largest energy requirement contribution is derived mainly from the manufacturing phase, representing 84.4{\%} of the total life cycle, and particularly from the tower construction which accounts for 55{\%} of the total turbine production. The average energy payback time for both turbines is found to be 7 months and the emissions 9 gCO2/kWh. Different scenarios regarding operation performance, recycling of materials and different manufacturing countries such as Germany, Denmark and China are analysed and the energy payback time and carbon dioxide values obtained. Finally, the wind energy plant is compared with other renewable and non-renewable sources of energy to conclude that wind energy is among the cleanest sources of energy available nowadays. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Hofstadter1980,
abstract = {Twenty years after it topped the bestseller charts, Douglas R Hofstadter's {\_}G{\"{o}}del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid{\_} is still something of a marvel. Besides being a profound and entertaining meditation on human thought and creativity, this book looks at the surprising points of contact between the music of Bach, the artwork of Escher, and the mathematics of G{\"{o}}del. It also looks at the prospects for computers and artificial intelligence (AI) for mimicking human thought. For the general reader and the computer techie alike, this book still sets a standard for thinking about the future of computers and their relation to the way we think. Hofstadter's great achievement in {\_}G{\"{o}}del, Escher, Bach{\_} was making abstruse mathematical topics (such as undecidability, recursion, and "strange loops") accessible and remarkably entertaining. Borrowing a page from Lewis Carroll (who might well have been a fan of this book), each chapter presents dialogue between the Tortoise and Achilles, as well as other characters who dramatise concepts discussed later in more detail. Allusions to Bach's music (centring on his Musical Offering) and Escher's continually paradoxical artwork are plentiful here. This more approachable material lets the author delve into serious number theory (concentrating on the ramifications of G{\"{o}}del's Theorem of Incompleteness) while stopping along the way to ponder the work of a host of other mathematicians, artists, and thinkers. The world has moved on since 1979, of course. The book predicted that computers probably won't ever beat humans in chess, though Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov in 1997. And the vinyl record, which serves for some of Hofstadter's best analogies, is now left to collectors. Sections on recursion and the graphs of certain functions from physics look tantalising, like the fractals of recent chaos theory. And AI has moved on, of course, with mixed results. Yet {\_}G{\"{o}}del, Escher, Bach{\_} remains a remarkable achievement. Its intellectual range and ability to let us visualise difficult mathematical concepts help make it one of this century's best for anyone who's interested in computers and their potential for real intelligence. --{\_}Richard Dragan{\_}},

abstract = {We, cities and regions' leaders from the five continents, gathered at the City Hall of Paris on Friday, December the 4 th , reaffirm our commitment to tackle climate disruption. We declare solemnly that climate change is our common challenge and that advancing climate solutions is a shared responsibility, and a matter of rights, equality and social justice. An effective, global response to climate change presents one of the greatest economic opportunities of the 21 st century, will protect public health, and strengthen sustainable development mindful of human rights and women's empowerment. We recognize that human-caused climate change already harms millions of citizens and its impact will last for decades. Continuing on the same high greenhouse gas emissions trajectory will result in disaster for our children, the environment and global biodiversity. Climate change action is the only path forward. Given that cities around the world are home to half the global population and their activities generate 2/3 of global greenhouse gas emissions, local and regional leaders have an increasingly important role to play in charting the course to a low carbon future. We — the undersigned mayors, governors, premiers, and other local government leaders — commit collectively to: • Advance and exceed the expected goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement to be reached at COP 21 to the full extent of our authorities; • Produce and implement participatory resilience strategies and action plans to adapt to the rising incidence of climate-related hazards by 2020; • Deliver up to 3.7 gigatons of urban greenhouse gas emissions reductions annually by 2030 — the equivalent of up to 30 {\%} of the difference between current national commitments and the 2 degree emissions reduction pathway identified by the scientific community; • Support ambitious long-term climate goals such as a transition to 100 {\%} renewable energy in our communities, or a 80 {\%} greenhouse gas emissions reduction by 2050; • Engage in partnerships among ourselves and with global organizations, national governments, the private sector, and civil society to enhance cooperation and capacity-building programs, scale-up climate change solutions, develop metrics and promote innovative finance mechanisms and investments in low-emission projects across the world. To reach these ambitious goals, we look forward to supporting a COP21 Paris Pledge for Action and will strengthen the ongoing initiatives of cities and regions' networks, in particular the Compact of Mayors, the Covenant of Mayors, and the Compact of States and Regions. We will support the UN NAZCA platform and the Local Government Climate Roadmap to ensure the visibility of these initiatives. Additionally, we recognize that our jurisdictions require increased access to climate finance, budget authority, and stronger legislative capacity to maximize climate change action, and we call for the empowerment of each level of government to make its maximum potential contribution toward climate change progress.},

While the principles for effective issues management don't real-ly change, social media adds complexity to crisis communica-tion. Multiple people can hijack your message and amplify that message further than you can by spreading the message on your own. Here are a few questions to help you assess the situ-ation: Can the issue be taken offline for a resolution?  Offline can put a halt to any social amplification. Is this the type of comment that might interest local or na-tional media?  When print or broadcast media pick up a negative thread, it becomes a " story " and gains a heightened level of intensity. Is the commenter an overactive tweeter or poster?  Their comments can sometimes get lost in their own noise. Should you apologize on social media for the problem you have caused if that is the root of the adverse sentiment?  An authentic apology is pivotal to protecting reputation. Are you in a position to continue to trade comments with the source of the negative sentiment?  You'll need writing resources in order to learn to manage social web dialogue.

abstract = {Economic evaluation of green or renewable power should compare the cost of renewable power with the cost savings from displaced fossil generation plus the avoided harm from reduced emissions of air pollution and greenhouse gases. We use existing estimates of the values of the harm and we calculate cost savings from renewable power based on wholesale spot prices of power in Ontario and steady-state estimates of the cost of new gas generation to estimate the value or affordability of various forms of renewable power in Ontario. We find that timing matters in evaluating intermittent renewable sources. Considering air pollution and greenhouse gases we find that coal generation is dominated by natural gas, supporting Ontario's policy of ending coal generation by 2014. Renewable power thus displaces gas. Dispatchable renewable generation sources, such as many biogas, biomass and some hydroelectric sites cause savings and reduced harm that can justify some of the Ontario Feed-in-Tariff prices up to {\$}130/MWh; other FIT prices are too high. Wind and solar power are variable, so the value of their power depends on system marginal costs when they generate. Wind's displacement of gas capacity costs is low because it cannot be depended upon when demand is high and generation is needed, so it justifies prices of only {\$}60 to {\$}95/MWh, less than the FIT price of {\$}115. Solar power justifies higher prices than wind, up to {\$}152/MWh because solar generates in the daytime when prices are higher and when solar can fairly reliably displace gas capacity. Still, solar power falls far short of justifying the 2012 Ontario FIT prices of {\$}347 to {\$}549/MWh. Ontario's Feed-in-Tariff program costs more than necessary to achieve its environmental goals.},

abstract = {The study aim was to identify risk factors for collisions/near-collisions involving on-road commuter cyclists and drivers. A naturalistic cycling study was conducted in Melbourne, Australia, with cyclists wearing helmet-mounted video cameras. Video recordings captured cyclists' perspective of the road and traffic behaviours including head checks, reactions and manoeuvres. The 100-car naturalistic driving study analysis technique was adapted for data analysis and events were classified by severity: collision, near-collision and incident. Participants were adult cyclists and each filmed 12 hours of commuter cycling trips over a 4-week period. In total, 127 hours and 38 minutes were analysed for 13 participants, 54 events were identified: 2 collisions, 6 near-collisions and 46 incidents. Prior to events, 88.9{\%} of cyclists travelled in a safe/legal manner. Sideswipe was the most frequent event type (40.7{\%}). Most events occurred at an intersection/intersection-related location (70.3{\%}). The vehicle driver was judged at fault in the majority of events (87.0{\%}) and no post-event driver reaction was observed (83.3{\%}). Cross tabulations revealed significant associations between event severity and: cyclist reaction, cyclist post-event manoeuvre, pre-event driver behaviour, other vehicle involved, driver reaction, visual obstruction, cyclist head check (left), event type and vehicle location (p{\textless}0.05). Frequent head checks suggest cyclists had high situational awareness and their reactive behaviour to driver actions led to successful avoidance of collisions/near-collisions. Strategies to improve driver awareness of on-road cyclists and to indicate early before turning/changing lanes when sharing the roadway with cyclists are discussed. Findings will contribute to the development of effective countermeasures to reduce cyclist trauma.},

abstract = {This paper develops a practical framework for estimating the wider economic benefits generated from transport investments. The methodologies for measuring the broader set of influences, including agglomeration economies, increased output in imperfectly-competitive markets and welfare benefits arising from improved labour supply are identified. The gross domestic product (GDP) impacts from transport investments (often used as a proxy measure for a number of economic impacts that are the result of increased productivity that are not included in the set of welfare benefits in the cost benefit analysis) are also explored. The wider economic benefits are illustrated by a real project - the North West Rail Link, a 23. km rail link in north west of Sydney with an estimated investment of {\$}8.3 billion. The Sydney Strategic Travel Model (STM) was used to model the changes of trips made from private cars, trains and buses, and changes in travel time, waiting time and the generalised travel costs. These are combined with macroeconomic data on employment and productivity to estimate the welfare benefits and GPD impacts of the project. The study indicates that the wider economic benefits represent an 8{\%} mark up over the conventional economic user benefits in the benefit-cost calculation, the latter comprising value of travel time savings, accident reduction, road decongestion and externality benefits.},

A reduction with a factor of 2 with regard to the present state of the art seems fairly easy achievable. This is however not sufficient for application at more exposed sites. Availability levels are lower than targeted, but moreover the O{\&}M cost turn out to be substantially higher than initially anticipated. The main cause for the high O{\&}M costs is the rather frequent need for an expensive external crane vessel. A second design round is necessary to reconsider the reliability levels adopted for almost all concepts. Furthermore a more "farm like design approach" is needed to reduce major maintenance cost and increase availability. INTRODUCTION},

abstract = {Here we sketch the rudiments of what constitutes a smart city which we define as a city in which ICT is merged with traditional infrastructures, coordinated and integrated using new digital technologies. We first sketch our vision defining seven goals which concern: developing a new understanding of urban problems; effective and feasible ways to coordinate urban technologies; models and methods for using urban data across spatial and temporal scales; developing new technologies for communication and dissemination; developing new forms of urban governance and organisation; defining critical problems relating to cities, transport, and energy; and identifying risk, uncertainty, and hazards in the smart city. To this, we add six research challenges: to relate the infrastructure of smart cities to their operational functioning and planning through management, control and optimisation; to explore the notion of the city as a laboratory for innovation; to provide portfolios of urban simulation which inform future designs; to develop technologies that ensure equity, fairness and realise a better quality of city life; to develop technologies that ensure informed participation and create shared knowledge for democratic city governance; and to ensure greater and more effective mobility and access to opportunities for urban populations. We begin by defining the state of the art, explaining the science of smart cities. We define six scenarios based on new cities badging themselves as smart, older cities regenerating themselves as smart, the development of science parks, tech cities, and technopoles focused on high technologies, the development of urban services using contemporary ICT, the use of ICT to develop new urban intelligence functions, and the development of online and mobile forms of participation. Seven project areas are then proposed: Integrated Databases for the Smart City, Sensing, Networking and the Impact of New Social Media, Modelling Network Performance, Mobility and Travel Behaviour, Modelling Urban Land Use, Transport and Economic Interactions, Modelling Urban Transactional Activities in Labour and Housing Markets, Decision Support as Urban Intelligence, Participatory Governance and Planning Structures for the Smart City. Finally we anticipate the paradigm shifts that will occur in this research and define a series of key demonstrators which we believe are important to progressing a science of smart cities.},

abstract = {Cities interact with and rely on energy in complex ways. Fundamentally cities rely upon high quality energy and outputs of low quality for their very existence. The energy flows and transformations enabling cities are tied to physical limits imposed by thermodynamics. Understanding of these limits and the relationships among energy and cities, it is revealed herein, is of vital importance to the sustainability of cities. Four contributions to this understanding are provided. The first articulates how the thermodynamic forces driving cities, together with the dynamic environment within which cities reside, stipulates what type of activities within cities are sustainable. Second, a model depicting the scaling relationship between urban energy use and economic output is devised, and it's fit to historical data demonstrated via nonlinear regression. By differentiating between energy used to grow and energy used to maintain economic output the model illustrates how reductions in these values on a per dollar basis abets growth while the reverse delays growth, or stops it altogether when energy needs for maintenance become too high. Third, an exergy network conceptualization of cities is developed that reveals the structure of the exergy flows in a city. The topology of the network drastically alters the city's ability to maximize usefulness of imported energy as well as alter that variability in the amount of usefulness extracted. Finally, the resilience of cities with respect to energy is presented by considering the energy storage and buffer capacity of the urban metabolism. The city of Toronto is shown to have adequate flexibility in food and transport fuels to withstand operation for days without undue interruption of typical activities. Together these differing aspects of the open nonequilibrium details of cities establish an improved prescription of the sustainable city.},

To make train- ing faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implemen- tation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called “dropout” that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3{\%}, compared to 26.2{\%} achieved by the second-best entry.},

In the present work we exploit the emerging dynamical systems perspective putting the focus on the role of the network topology underlying the relationships between cognitive processes. We go through a couple of models of distinct cognitive phenomena and yet find the conditions for them to be mathematically equivalent. We find a non-trivial attractor of the system that corresponds to the exact definition of a well-known network centrality and hence stress the interplay between the dynamics and the underlying network connectivity, showing that both of the two are relevant. The connectivity structure between cognitive processes is not known but yet it is not any. Regardless of the network considered, it is always possible to recover a positive manifold of correlations. However, we show that different network topologies lead to different plausible statistical models concerning correlations structure, ranging from one to multiple factors models and richer correlation structures.},

abstract = {Nutrition is recognised as one of the major health determinants. It is currently estimated in the scientific community that an unhealthy diet and a sedentary life style may be responsible for up to one third of the cases of cancers, and for premature deaths due to cardiovascular diseases. Nutrition is also an important determinant for the prevalence of obesity, which continues to rise in the European Community both among children and among adults. There is an urgent need to launch a public debate across the European Union between citizens, scientists and policymakers on this vital health issue. But given the diverse cultures and traditions linked to nutrition and behaviour across the European Union, any such debate must take scientific evidence as a starting point. With this in mind, in 1998 the European Commission funded a project with the aim to contribute towards a co-ordinated approach on nutrition, diet and healthy lifestyles – the " Eurodiet " project. Since its inception, the " Eurodiet " project has provided much food for thought regarding the links between health and nutrients, the translation of nutrient requirements to food-based guidelines and effective promotion of these foods and healthy lifestyles. This " Eurodiet " Core Report addresses a wide range of significant issues. In setting out its views on the options available to policymakers, I am sure that this report will serve to stimulate a lively discussion on contemporary European nutrition issues. Having held a thorough debate on these issues, we will then be better placed to identify appropriate initiatives to tackle this key determinant at European, national, local, and indeed the individual level. At European level this is important, given the priority put on the issue of nutrition in the new Public Health Action Programme and in terms of follow up to the White Paper on Food Safety. I am therefore happy to present the results of the " Eurodiet " project in this publication, hoping that it will provide a starting point for further debate, discussion and research in the field of nutrition, lifestyle and public health.},

This problem is especially hard to solve for time series classification and regression in industrial applications such as predictive maintenance or production line optimization, for which each label or regression target is associated with several time series and meta-information simultaneously. Here, we are proposing an efficient, scalable feature extraction algorithm for time series, which filters the available features in an early stage of the machine learning pipeline with respect to their significance for the classification or regression task, while controlling the expected percentage of selected but irrelevant features. The proposed algorithm combines established feature extraction methods with a feature importance filter. It has a low computational complexity, allows to start on a problem with only limited domain knowledge available, can be trivially parallelized, is highly scalable and based on well studied non-parametric hypothesis tests. We benchmark our proposed algorithm on all binary classification problems of the UCR time series classification archive as well as time series from a production line optimization project and simulated stochastic processes with underlying qualitative change of dynamics.},

abstract = {Cycling has consistently been safer in the Netherlands than the UK. Nevertheless, safety has improved in both countries over time. Between 1980 and 2011, the cyclists' fatality rate declined by 67{\%} in the Netherlands and 57{\%} in the UK. Per capita bicycle use was sustained in the Netherlands throughout the post-World War Two era, peaking in the early 1960s and only declining for a decade before recovering. In contrast, UK bicycle use peaked in 1952 and declined permanently. The survival of popular bicycling in the Netherlands through the 1950s and 1960s was fundamental to the development of effective bicycling policies after the 1970s. The Dutch network of cycle tracks and routes increased from 9,000. km in the mid 1970s to approximately 29,000. km currently. The annual distance cycled per capita increased by 30{\%} in the ten years to 1988, but has not materially increased since then. In the UK, cycling has a long heritage as a marginalised form of travel. This continues to hinder efforts to achieve a national cycling revival. Nevertheless, cycling on quiet urban and rural roads in the UK incurs much lower risks than the national average fatality rate would suggest. Networks enabling cyclists to avoid main roads, especially rural A-roads, could provide safety levels comparable to the Netherlands and Denmark. There are towns in the UK with segregated cycling networks, but few cyclists. This is because a range of measures must be invoked to achieve large modal shifts to cycling. Local authority support is a critical factor.},

abstract = {The nation's growth and the need to meet mobility, environmental, and energy objectives place demands on public transit systems. Current systems, some of which are old and in need of upgrading, must expand service area, increase service frequency, and improve efficiency to serve these demands. Research is necessary to solve operating problems, to adapt appropriate new technologies from other industries, and to introduce innovations into the transit industry. The Transit Cooperative Research Program (TCRP) serves as one of the principal means by which the transit industry can develop innovative near-term solutions to meet demands placed on it. The need for TCRP was originally identified in TRB Special Report 213—Research for Public Transit: New Directions, published in 1987 and based on a study sponsored by the Urban Project H-12 FY'96 ISSN 1073-4872 ISBN 0-309-06324-8 Library of Congress Catalog Card No. 99-71031 . 1999 Transportation Research Board Price {\$}22.00ID - 1535},

abstract = {The Greater Golden Horseshoe Model (GGHM) is an advanced forecasting tool developed within the last year to address the transport planning and design needs of the greater Toronto Metropolitan Region, one of the fastest growing urban areas in North America. This new regional model contains a number of innovative features. All of the necessary data was available (2011 Transportation Travel Survey of 150,000 households, 2011 census, and thousands of highway volume counts) to develop all of the proposed recommendations. The GGHM contains a first step towards a full Activity Based Model with deployment of the framework developed for Phase I in San Diego. It includes a subset of ABM model components including a population synthesizer, auto ownership, long term location choice models and a daily activity pattern model. The transition to a trip-based framework follows the daily activity pattern model and begins with destination and mode choice, and assignment. A major element of the model was the incorporation of capacity, crowding and reliability in both mode choice and transit trip assignment. Capacity and crowding was first implemented in Sydney. The development and application of the model was based upon an intensive literature search and a stated preference (SP) survey. The Sydney work was considerably expanded to include stop and link reliability in Los Angeles. The Los Angeles work also included an even more detailed SP survey from respondents who experience over-capacity and crowded transit conditions on a daily basis. One of the key features of the nested logit mode choice model was the inclusion of a variable that measures the “benefit”, in the peak period, of the presence and frequency of off-peak GO Rail service. Estimation results from a stated-preference survey yielded a coefficient value that was equal to 8.2 minutes of equivalent in-vehicle time. The 8.2 minute benefit corresponded to approximately 10 minute service frequency. The new version of the GGHM included development of three special market models, including an air passenger, visitor and special event model. Initial applications of the model were for a region wide High-Occupancy Toll (HOT) lane study and a Metrolinx Transit System wide study.},

In Europe Denmark has played a particularly prominent part in developing the technology and has installed a large numbers of turbines. The paper is concerned with the influence of the weather on the reliability of modern wind turbines and in particular the effect of wind speed. The prime objective of the work is to extract information from existing reliability data to draw conclusions about how the wind speed affects turbine reliability and which subassemblies in the turbine it affects the most. The purpose is to make information available to turbine manufacturers and operators so that the reliability of new wind turbine designs can be improved, particularly if they are to be installed offshore, where the weather is more inclement. Data are collected from Windstats for historic, maintained, Danish wind turbines and on-line data collected for the Danish weather. These data are used to analyse the reliability of wind turbines and their subassemblies in varying weather conditions from 1994-2004. The paper describes practical methods of extracting information from windturbine reliability data and shows how turbine design, turbine configuration, time and the weather can affect the extracted results.},

This paper aims to explore the impacts of lateral transshipments on the stability, bullwhip effect, and other performance measurements in the context of a two-tiered supply chain systemcomposed of one supplier and two retailers. In particular, we developed a unified discrete-time state space model to address two different scenarios of placing orders. Analytical stability results are derived, throughwhichwe found that inappropriate lateral transshipment policies readily destabilize the supply chain system. Moreover, the lead time of lateral transshipments further complicates the stability problem. Theoretical results are validated through simulation experiments and the influences of system parameters on performance measures are investigated numerically. Numerical simulations show that lateral transshipments help improve the customer service level for both retailers. It is also interesting to observe that the demand of the two retailers can be satisfied even if only one retailer places orders fromthe upstream supplier.},

@article{Crawford2009,
abstract = {Wind turbines, used to generate renewable energy, are typically considered to take only a number of months to produce as much energy as is required in their manufacture and operation. With a life expectancy of upwards of 20 years, the energy produced by wind turbines over their life can be many times greater than that embodied in their production. Many previous life cycle energy studies of wind turbines are based on methods of assessment now known to be incomplete. These studies may underestimate the energy embodied in wind turbines by more than 50{\%}, potentially overestimating the energy yield of those systems and possibly affecting the comparison of energy generation options. With the increasing trend towards larger scale wind turbines, comes a respective increase in the energy required for their manufacture. It is important to consider whether or not these increases in wind turbine size, and thus embodied energy, can be adequately justified by equivalent increases in the energy yield of such systems. This paper presents the results of a life cycle energy and greenhouse emissions analysis of two wind turbines and considers the effect of wind turbine size on energy yield. The issue of incompleteness associated with many past life cycle energy studies is also addressed. Energy yield ratios of 21 and 23 were found for a small and large scale wind turbine, respectively. The embodied energy component was found to be more significant than in previous studies, emphasised here due to the innovative use of a hybrid embodied energy analysis approach. The life cycle energy requirements were shown to be offset by the energy produced within the first 12 months of operation. The size of wind turbines appears to not be an important factor in optimising their life cycle energy performance. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This success has increased the interest in exploring the factors affecting bicycle-sharing flows and usage. Using data compiled as minute-by-minute readings of bicycle availability at all the stations of the BIXI system between April and August 2012, this study contributes to the literature on bicycle-sharing. We examine the influence of meteorological data, temporal characteristics, bicycle infrastructure, land use and built environment attributes on arrival and departure flows at the station level using a multilevel approach to statistical modeling, which could easily be applied to other regions. The findings allow us to identify factors contributing to increased usage of bicycle-sharing in Montreal and to provide recommendations pertaining to station size and location decisions. The developed methodology and findings can be of benefit to city planners and engineers who are designing or modifying bicycle-sharing systems with the goal of maximizing usage and availability.},

abstract = {Minor bicycle accidents are defined as "bicycle accidents not involving death or heavily injured persons, implying that possible hospital visits last less than 24 hours". Statistics about these accidents and related injuries are very poor, because they are mostly not reported to police, hospitals or insurance companies. Yet, they form a major share of all bicycle accidents. Official registrations underestimate the number of minor accidents and do not provide cost data, nor the distance cycled. Therefore related policies are hampered by a lack of accurate data. This paper provides more insight into the importance of minor bicycle accidents and reports the frequency, risk and resulting costs of minor bicycle accidents. Direct costs, including the damage to bike and clothes as well as medical costs and indirect costs such as productivity loss and leisure time lost are calculated. We also estimate intangible costs of pain and psychological suffering and costs for other parties involved in the accident. Data were collected during the SHAPES project using several electronic surveys. The weekly prospective registration that lasted a year, covered 1187 persons that cycled 1,474,978 km. 219 minor bicycle accidents were reported. Resulting in a frequency of 148 minor bicycle accidents per million kilometres. We analyzed the economic costs related to 118 minor bicycle accidents in detail. The average total cost of these accidents is estimated at 841 euro (95{\%} CI: 579-1205) per accident or 0.125 euro per kilometre cycled. Overall, productivity loss is the most important component accounting for 48{\%} of the total cost. Intangible costs, which in past research were mostly neglected, are an important burden related to minor bicycle accidents (27{\%} of the total cost). Even among minor accidents there are important differences in the total cost depending on the severity of the injury. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Additionally, we consider its scale: micro, meso and macro. The analysis draws attention to legal, social and economic constraints and opportunities. It suggests that future priorities for research should be directed towards (i) strategically identifying principles of sustainable urban agriculture that help policy makers to design resilient cities, e.g. using flood-prone areas for food and employment, and (ii) operationally trialling innovative institutional mechanisms, e.g. differential land taxes to support sustainable urban agriculture or payments for environmental services provided by urban agriculture such as carbon sequestration.},

Evidence is presented that there are at least four separate mechanisms, inbuilt into the British system, which result in a systematic undersupply of land and space for both residential and commercial purposes and that these have had important effects on both our housing market and the wider economy and on welfare more widely defined.},

Here, we present a test of this extension in a simulated urban retailing system. We also consider in more depth the supply side of the Harris-Wilson framework and show how discontinuous changes between non-zero equilibria can be modeled. Until now this has been impossible due to the previously restricted nature of the model. The generalization presented and examined here also allows an investigation of the trade-off between the size and the location of retail outlets and of the effects of different types of consumer shopping behavior.},

abstract = {Demand for housing in walkable neighborhoods has been increasing rapidly in recent years, as has evidence of the benefits of walkable urban form and walking. These neighborhoods nevertheless remain in short supply, especially for low-income residents. Furthermore, crime, poor market strength, or racial segregation potentially compromise accessibility in lower income neighborhoods. We assess the nationwide supply of urban neighborhoods with walkable access and the extent to which U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)-assisted voucher and project housing enables tenants to live in these neighborhoods. For assisted tenants with walkable access, we analyze whether or not this access is compromised. We aggregated more than 20 million address-level records (2010 to 2012) to the neighborhood level from about a dozen sources to characterize walkable access (using Walk Score), HUD-assisted housing, potential compromising factors, and other neighborhood characteristics. More detailed data were also collected for Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Miami, Phoenix, and Seattle. We use descriptive methods and logistic regressions to analyze patterns across metropolitan statistical areas, in regions, and between cities and suburbs. We find that only 14 percent of all neighborhoods and 13 percent of all housing units in U.S. metropolitan areas have good walkable access. Public housing has the most walkable access (37 percent), followed by project-based rental assistance (PBRA; 30 percent) and low-income housing tax credits (LIHTC) and housing choice vouchers (both about 23 percent). Accessibility is disproportionately compromised for all tenants (9 percentage points more for public housing and 2 to 3 percentage points more for vouchers, LIHTC, and PBRA) but especially so for public housing tenants in urban areas. For a disproportionate number of other tenants in public housing and PBRA (4 percentage points more than all rental units), accessibility is not compromised, especially in denser cores of suburban areas. Locating public housing and PBRA units in walkable suburbs is one of the mechanisms that work to provide both accessibility and affordability. In areas with more HUD-assisted housing, the quality of amenities and urban form is poorer and safety is worse than in other accessible neighborhoods, which is not captured by quantitative measures of walkable access. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of these findings.},

Its primary mandate was – and is – two-fold: to promote energy security amongst its member countries through collective response to physical disruptions in oil supply, and provide authoritative research and analysis on ways to ensure reliable, affordable and clean energy for its 29 member countries and beyond. The IEA carries out a comprehensive programme of energy co-operation among its member countries, each of which is obliged to hold oil stocks equivalent to 90 days of its net imports. The Agency's aims include the following objectives: n Secure member countries' access to reliable and ample supplies of all forms of energy; in particular, through maintaining effective emergency response capabilities in case of oil supply disruptions. n Promote sustainable energy policies that spur economic growth and environmental protection in a global context – particularly in terms of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions that contribute to climate change. n Improve transparency of international markets through collection and analysis of energy data. n Support global collaboration on energy technology to secure future energy supplies and mitigate their environmental impact, including through improved energy efficiency and development and deployment of low-carbon technologies. n Find solutions to global energy challenges through engagement and dialogue with non-member countries, industry, international organisations and other stakeholders.},

abstract = {Renewable energy sources are often presented as "clean". A more correct definition is that they are "cleaner" than ones based on fossil fuel conversion. When the energy consumption and the environmental impacts related to the plant's life-cycle are considered, a more comprehensive assessment of these technologies can be carried out. This paper aims to evaluate the energy and the environmental performances of the electricity production of a wind farm. The impacts related to all the phases of the wind farm construction and operation have been compared to the environmental benefits due to the "green" electricity generation during its useful life. In other terms, the goal is to trace the ecoprofile of the production of 1 kWh of electricity. A life cycle assessment (LCA) has been performed based on data related to an Italian wind farm: production and deliver of energy and raw materials, components manufacturing, transports, installation, maintenance, disassembly and disposal have been analysed. The attention focused to those life cycle steps generally neglected or not adequately investigated as installation, civil works and maintenance. The results can be assumed as representative of the Italian context and they can represent a further incentive to the diffusion of wind farms. In fact, the environmental performances of the wind farm have been compared to other power energy generation systems. The results showed a great environmental convenience of the inquired technology. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The LUT modeling with Agent-Based simulation has been evolving in the last 20 years and there are some complete models being applied to real metropolitan areas. In this paper, only some of the ingredients of those models are presented in an easy to explain agent-based model that can be used in classes. The model is based on a more simple one available in the software package Anylogic which was upgraded with many add-ons coming from transportation systems analysis requirements that have been introduced at TU Delft. The model logic is explained, including the way in which it can be used to run different experiments.

The techniques are brought together into one system to collate their output and provide a single decision support environment for an operator. The framework used is a novel multi-agent system architecture that offers the opportunity to corroborate the output of the various interpretation techniques in order to improve the accuracy of fault detection.

abstract = {Objective The primary objective was to evaluate the effect of statin therapy/lipid lowering therapy (LLT) on lipid profile, in adults presenting with first acute coronary event. Methods and material A multicentre, observational, prospective cohort study of lipid profiles pre- and post-statin therapy/LLT, among adult patients with confirmed diagnosis of first acute coronary event. The primary outcome measures were low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in mg/dl, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in mg/dl and triglycerides (TG) in mg/dl at baseline and end of study (EOS, 12 weeks [mean: 13.5 weeks]). Results Totally 474 patients completed the study. Number of patients with any LDL-C abnormality (LDL-C [all; LDL was abnormal, either alone or along with other lipid parameter(s)]) decreased from 118 (24.9{\%}) to 27 (5.7{\%}), and for LDL-C (only; only the LDL was abnormal), from 46 (9.7{\%}) to 13 (2.7{\%}), both from baseline to EOS. Of 118 patients with high LDL-C (all) at baseline, 91 (77.1{\%}) had reduction in LDL-C to {\textless}100 mg/dl, of which 54 (45.8{\%}) had LDL-C {\textless}70 mg/dl at EOS. The patients with LDL-C fraction abnormalities decreased, while HDL-C abnormalities increased at EOS from baseline. No major difference was observed at baseline and EOS in levels of TG (all [TG was abnormal, either alone or along with other lipid parameter(s)]) and TG (only [only the TG was abnormal]). Six (1.3{\%}) had seven serious adverse events. Conclusions Though statin therapy is effective in lowering LDL-C, there still remains residual dyslipidemia, which probably should be tackled with therapeutic and non-therapeutic options.Copyright {\textcopyright} 2016 Cardiological Society of India},

Many common approaches do not provide a good picture of the actual system behavior, because they neglect feedback loops, instabilities and cascade effects. The complex and often counter-intuitive behavior of social systems and their macro-level collective dynamics can be better understood by means of complexity science. We highlight that a suitable system design and management can help to stop undesirable cascade effects and to enable favorable kinds of self-organization in the system. In such a way, complexity science can help to save human lives. },

@techreport{Widrow1960,
abstract = {A new circuit element called a "memistor" (a resistor with memory) has been devised that will have general use in adaptive circuits. With such an element it is possible to get an electronically variable gain control along with the memory required for storage of the system's experiences or training. Experiences are stored in their most compact form, and in a form that is directly usable from the standpoint of system functioning. The element consists of a resistive graphite substrate immersed in a plating bath. The resistance is reversibly controlled by elecroplating. The memistror element has been applied to the realization of adaptive neurons. Memistor circuits for the "Adaline" neuron, which inporporate its simple adaption procedure, have been developed. It has been possible to train these neurons so that this training will remain effective for weeks. Steps have been taken toward the minituarization of the memistor element. The memistor promises a cheap, reliable, mass-producible, adaptive-system element.},

Although very different from each other, they are all becoming available as a side-effect since they were created with different purposes but their degree of popularity, pervasiveness and ease of access is turning them into interesting alternatives for researchers. Existing projects and initiatives that conform to each class are featured as illustrative examples of these new potential sources of knowledge. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},
