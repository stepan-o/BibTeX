abstract = {At Carbon Engineering, we have built a prototype air contactor with 10m3of packing volume, and have absorbed carbon dioxide from ambient air for over 1000 hours of outdoor operation. Our prototype was built to: A) test our cross-flow, pulsed-liquid, PVC packing-based contactor design in an operational environment; b) to evaluate fan and liquid pumping energy requirements of our design; c) to assess technical and safety risks involved with liquid solution loss through entrained "drift" droplets, and; d) to examine for packing or solution fouling by atmospheric particulates. In this paper we present our results on the liquid pumping and fan energy requirements of our prototype, and show preliminary analyses we have conducted on liquid loss through "drift" droplets and NPE fouling. Our operation with pulsed liquid flow allows us to fully wet the surface of our structured packing with a brief period of full flow, then to cut flow for a duration of several minutes to let the liquid slowly react away as CO2is absorbed. Using this technique we have cut average liquid flow to 10{\%} of full manufacturer's specifications while retaining an average of over 80{\%} of the capture rate observed at full flow. This method, under patent application, has allowed us to reduce our mgh fluid pumping energy requirement for the contactor to {\textless}40 MJ/ton-CO2({\textless}11 kWh/ton-CO2). Here we report this energy requirement without accounting for pump efficiency, which we nominally assume to be $\eta$pump=90{\%}. Our prototype contactor has utilized high-performance XF12560 structured packing from Brentwood Industries (Reading, PA), manufactured from PVC rather than a stainless-steel. This choice has given us several advantages, chiefly that it costs far less on a per-surface-area basis, and that is provides a much lower pressure drop on a per- surface-area basis. We have previously shown data that suggests these plastic packings absorb CO2with equal performance to traditional stainless-steel designs once wetted properly [1]. The high-performance and low pressure drop characteristics of our XF12560 product have allowed us to achieve PV work requirements of {\textless}350 MJ/ton-CO2({\textless}100 kWh/ton-CO2). Again, this value does not reflect fan efficiency, which we commonly use as $\eta$fan=55{\%} in our analyses. This current value for PV work requirement is higher than we had previously reported, due to a specific cause of under-performance in our prototype which is discussed in this paper. Despite this, we are in fact very encouraged by the results of our first attempt at long-duration outdoor contacting, and we have numerous design improvements stemming from our prototype operation that will be included in the next iteration of our full-scale contactor design. Extensive air sampling was carried out during our contactor operation to measure the loss of liquid solution via "drift" droplets during normal pulesd-flow contactor operation, 6 hour air samples taken from the contact outflow and measured for our K+ ion tracer, showed OH concentrations to be {\textless}5{\%} of the OHSA regulated indoor respiratory requirement. After our 1000 hours of integrated CO2absorption time, we have as of yet been unable to observe any significant performance decrease in the absorptive properties of our working solution or in the efficiency of our structured packing product.},

abstract = {We, cities and regions' leaders from the five continents, gathered at the City Hall of Paris on Friday, December the 4 th , reaffirm our commitment to tackle climate disruption. We declare solemnly that climate change is our common challenge and that advancing climate solutions is a shared responsibility, and a matter of rights, equality and social justice. An effective, global response to climate change presents one of the greatest economic opportunities of the 21 st century, will protect public health, and strengthen sustainable development mindful of human rights and women's empowerment. We recognize that human-caused climate change already harms millions of citizens and its impact will last for decades. Continuing on the same high greenhouse gas emissions trajectory will result in disaster for our children, the environment and global biodiversity. Climate change action is the only path forward. Given that cities around the world are home to half the global population and their activities generate 2/3 of global greenhouse gas emissions, local and regional leaders have an increasingly important role to play in charting the course to a low carbon future. We — the undersigned mayors, governors, premiers, and other local government leaders — commit collectively to: • Advance and exceed the expected goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement to be reached at COP 21 to the full extent of our authorities; • Produce and implement participatory resilience strategies and action plans to adapt to the rising incidence of climate-related hazards by 2020; • Deliver up to 3.7 gigatons of urban greenhouse gas emissions reductions annually by 2030 — the equivalent of up to 30 {\%} of the difference between current national commitments and the 2 degree emissions reduction pathway identified by the scientific community; • Support ambitious long-term climate goals such as a transition to 100 {\%} renewable energy in our communities, or a 80 {\%} greenhouse gas emissions reduction by 2050; • Engage in partnerships among ourselves and with global organizations, national governments, the private sector, and civil society to enhance cooperation and capacity-building programs, scale-up climate change solutions, develop metrics and promote innovative finance mechanisms and investments in low-emission projects across the world. To reach these ambitious goals, we look forward to supporting a COP21 Paris Pledge for Action and will strengthen the ongoing initiatives of cities and regions' networks, in particular the Compact of Mayors, the Covenant of Mayors, and the Compact of States and Regions. We will support the UN NAZCA platform and the Local Government Climate Roadmap to ensure the visibility of these initiatives. Additionally, we recognize that our jurisdictions require increased access to climate finance, budget authority, and stronger legislative capacity to maximize climate change action, and we call for the empowerment of each level of government to make its maximum potential contribution toward climate change progress.},
