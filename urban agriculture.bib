abstract = {AN ANALYSIS OF FAO'S 2018-2019 WORK PLAN ➨ Agroecology accounts for eight percent of FAO's results planned for 2018-2019 that support transitions to sustainable food and agriculture. ➨ Two-thirds (64 percent) of these results will be delivered in 78 countries across all five geographic regions addressing food security, nutrition and health, access to markets for local production, family-and small-scale production, climate-resilient approaches, sustainable natural resource management and sustainable food systems and livelihoods. ➨ Opportunities exist for further incorporating and upscaling agroecology in FAO's work through better integration of the agricultural sectors (crop and livestock production, forestry, aquaculture and fisheries) and transition towards sustainable food systems approaches in collaboration with partners particularly at country and regional levels. Agroecology can support the achievement of multiple objectives – economic, environmental, social, nutritional, health and cultural – holistically. It is an approach that contributes directly to the achievement of thirteen of the Sustainable Development Goals, while significantly increasing the resilience of both people and the environment, mitigating climate change, and sustainably using and conserving natural resources and biodiversity. A systemic approach, involving relevant agricultural and food sectors and stakeholders in the broad adoption of agroecology, has the potential to greatly accelerate the transition to sustainable and resilient food systems, in line with the various international commitments made by member nations. Based on an analysis of FAO's work plan for 2018-2019, this document presents an overview of FAO's engagement in agroecology and summarizes the main gaps and opportunities for upscaling. The criteria of analysis are based on four levels of changes to convert today's agricultural production and food systems to agroecological food systems (levels of transition; Fig. 1). 1 1 A case by case analysis of FAO's results agreed in the 2018-2019 Work Plan has been conducted classifying the results regarding their contribution to one or more of the four levels of transition. The four levels of transition towards agroecology based sustainable agriculture and food systems are closely related to FAO's five principles of Sustainable Food and Agriculture:},

@article{Rajala2001,
abstract = {Nutrition is recognised as one of the major health determinants. It is currently estimated in the scientific community that an unhealthy diet and a sedentary life style may be responsible for up to one third of the cases of cancers, and for premature deaths due to cardiovascular diseases. Nutrition is also an important determinant for the prevalence of obesity, which continues to rise in the European Community both among children and among adults. There is an urgent need to launch a public debate across the European Union between citizens, scientists and policymakers on this vital health issue. But given the diverse cultures and traditions linked to nutrition and behaviour across the European Union, any such debate must take scientific evidence as a starting point. With this in mind, in 1998 the European Commission funded a project with the aim to contribute towards a co-ordinated approach on nutrition, diet and healthy lifestyles – the " Eurodiet " project. Since its inception, the " Eurodiet " project has provided much food for thought regarding the links between health and nutrients, the translation of nutrient requirements to food-based guidelines and effective promotion of these foods and healthy lifestyles. This " Eurodiet " Core Report addresses a wide range of significant issues. In setting out its views on the options available to policymakers, I am sure that this report will serve to stimulate a lively discussion on contemporary European nutrition issues. Having held a thorough debate on these issues, we will then be better placed to identify appropriate initiatives to tackle this key determinant at European, national, local, and indeed the individual level. At European level this is important, given the priority put on the issue of nutrition in the new Public Health Action Programme and in terms of follow up to the White Paper on Food Safety. I am therefore happy to present the results of the " Eurodiet " project in this publication, hoping that it will provide a starting point for further debate, discussion and research in the field of nutrition, lifestyle and public health.},

@article{Pearson2010,
abstract = {This paper reviews research on urban agriculture which relates to the three dimensions of sustainability: social, economic and environmental. We propose that urban agriculture has three elements: urban agriculture in isolation; its interface with the people and environment within which it is situated; and its contribution to the design of built form. Additionally, we consider its scale: micro, meso and macro. The analysis draws attention to legal, social and economic constraints and opportunities. It suggests that future priorities for research should be directed towards (i) strategically identifying principles of sustainable urban agriculture that help policy makers to design resilient cities, e.g. using flood-prone areas for food and employment, and (ii) operationally trialling innovative institutional mechanisms, e.g. differential land taxes to support sustainable urban agriculture or payments for environmental services provided by urban agriculture such as carbon sequestration.},

@article{Pretty2008,
abstract = {Concerns about sustainability in agricultural systems centre on the need to develop technologies and practices that do not have adverse effects on environmental goods and services, are accessible to and effective for farmers, and lead to improvements in food productivity. Despite great progress in agricultural productivity in the past half-century, with crop and livestock productivity strongly driven by increased use of fertilizers, irrigation water, agricultural machinery, pesticides and land, it would be over-optimistic to assume that these relationships will remain linear in the future. New approaches are needed that will integrate biological and ecological processes into food production, minimize the use of those non-renewable inputs that cause harm to the environment or to the health of farmers and consumers, make productive use of the knowledge and skills of farmers, so substituting human capital for costly external inputs, and make productive use of people's collective capacities to work together to solve common agricultural and natural resource problems, such as for pest, watershed, irrigation, forest and credit management. These principles help to build important capital assets for agricultural systems: natural; social; human; physical; and financial capital. Improving natural capital is a central aim, and dividends can come from making the best use of the genotypes of crops and animals and the ecological conditions under which they are grown or raised. Agricultural sustainability suggests a focus on both genotype improvements through the full range of modern biological approaches and improved understanding of the benefits of ecological and agronomic management, manipulation and redesign. The ecological management of agroecosystems that addresses energy flows, nutrient cycling, population-regulating mechanisms and system resilience can lead to the redesign of agriculture at a landscape scale. Sustainable agriculture outcomes can be positive for food productivity, reduced pesticide use and carbon balances. Significant challenges, however, remain to develop national and international policies to support the wider emergence of more sustainable forms of agricultural production across both industrialized and developing countries.},

abstract = {Nineteenth-century landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted described his most famous project, the design of New York's Central Park, as "a democratic development of highest significance." Over the years, the significance of green in civic life has grown. In twenty-first-century America, not only open space but also other issues of sustainability—such as potable water and carbon footprints—have become crucial elements in the quality of life in the city and surrounding environment. Confronted by a U.S. population that is more than 70 percent urban, growing concern about global warming, rising energy prices, and unabated globalization, today's decision makers must find ways to bring urban life into balance with the Earth in order to sustain the natural, economic, and political environment of the modern city.In Growing Greener Cities, a collection of essays on urban sustainability and environmental issues edited by Eugenie L. Birch and Susan M. Wachter, scholars and practitioners alike promote activities that recognize and conserve nature's ability to sustain urban life. These essays demonstrate how partnerships across professional organizations, businesses, advocacy groups, governments, and individuals themselves can bring green solutions to cities from London to Seattle. Beyond park and recreational spaces, initiatives that fall under the green umbrella range from public transit and infrastructure improvement to aquifer protection and urban agriculture.Growing Greener Cities offers an overview of the urban green movement, case studies in effective policy implementation, and tools for measuring and managing success. Thoroughly illustrated with color graphs, maps, and photographs, Growing Greener Cities provides a panoramic view of urban sustainability and environmental issues for green-minded city planners, policy makers, and citizens.},
