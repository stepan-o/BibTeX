abstract = {Recently, the environmental impact of wind farms has been receiving increasing attention. As land is more extensively exploited for onshore wind farms, they are more likely to be in proximity with human dwellings, increasing the likelihood of a negative health impact. Noise generation and propagation remain an important concern for wind farm's stakeholders, as compliance with mandatory noise limits is an integral part of the permitting process. In contrast to previous work that included noise only as a design constraint, this work presents continuous-location models for layout optimization that take noise and energy as objective functions, in order to fully characterize the design and performance spaces of the wind farm layout optimization (WFLOP) problem. Based on Jensen's wake model and ISO-9613-2 noise calculations, single-and multi-objective genetic algorithms (GAs) are used to solve the optimization problem. Results from this bi-objective optimization model illustrate the trade-off between energy generation and noise production by identifying several key parts of Pareto frontiers. In particular, it was observed that different regions of a Pareto front correspond to markedly different turbine layouts. The implications of noise regulation policy-in terms of the actual noise limit-on the design of wind farms are discussed, particularly in relation to the entire spectrum of design options. {\textcopyright} 2014 by ASME.},

abstract = {The DOWEC projects aims at implementation of large wind turbines in large scale wind farms. part of the DOWEC project a concepts study was performed regarding the achievable reliability and availability levels. A reduction with a factor of 2 with regard to the present state of the art seems fairly easy achievable. This is however not sufficient for application at more exposed sites. Availability levels are lower than targeted, but moreover the O{\&}M cost turn out to be substantially higher than initially anticipated. The main cause for the high O{\&}M costs is the rather frequent need for an expensive external crane vessel. A second design round is necessary to reconsider the reliability levels adopted for almost all concepts. Furthermore a more "farm like design approach" is needed to reduce major maintenance cost and increase availability. INTRODUCTION},

@article{Tavner2006,
abstract = {Wind turbines have been erected in increasing numbers in Europe, the USA and elsewhere. In Europe Denmark has played a particularly prominent part in developing the technology and has installed a large numbers of turbines. The paper is concerned with the influence of the weather on the reliability of modern wind turbines and in particular the effect of wind speed. The prime objective of the work is to extract information from existing reliability data to draw conclusions about how the wind speed affects turbine reliability and which subassemblies in the turbine it affects the most. The purpose is to make information available to turbine manufacturers and operators so that the reliability of new wind turbine designs can be improved, particularly if they are to be installed offshore, where the weather is more inclement. Data are collected from Windstats for historic, maintained, Danish wind turbines and on-line data collected for the Danish weather. These data are used to analyse the reliability of wind turbines and their subassemblies in varying weather conditions from 1994-2004. The paper describes practical methods of extracting information from windturbine reliability data and shows how turbine design, turbine configuration, time and the weather can affect the extracted results.},

@article{Zaher2009,
abstract = {This paper describes a set of anomaly-detection techniques and their applicability to wind turbine fault identification. It explains how the anomaly-detection techniques have been adopted to analyse supervisory control and data acquisition data acquired from a wind farm, automating and simplifying the operators' analysis task by interpreting the volume of data available. The techniques are brought together into one system to collate their output and provide a single decision support environment for an operator. The framework used is a novel multi-agent system architecture that offers the opportunity to corroborate the output of the various interpretation techniques in order to improve the accuracy of fault detection. The results presented demonstrate that the interpretation techniques can provide performance assessment and early fault identification, thereby giving the operators sufficient time to make more informed decisions regarding the maintenance of their machines.},
